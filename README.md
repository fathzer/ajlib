A-JLib is a simple java library with Swing widgets, utilities and other stuff.

It tries to simplify the development of Swing applications ... which is, sometime, a nightmare!<br>
It contains the classes I developed during the <a href="https://www.yapbam.net">Yapbam project</a> in
order to deal with the problems I encountered.

It requires Java 7+ and is released under Apache 2 License.

A demonstration of Swing widgets is available at [https://fathzer.github.io/ajlib/ajlib-demo.jar](https://fathzer.github.io/ajlib/ajlib-demo.jar).  
It is a runnable jar. After you've downloaded it, run it using:
`java -jar ajlib-demo.jar`
Javadoc is available [here](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.fathzer/ajlib).
